          "Jesus, himself, used food and conversations as methods to teach and learn. Open Door Christian Community follows this method by provide a home-cooked meal to all – all faiths and backgrounds. Those that join us for dinner come from Christian, Hindu, Baha’I, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Agnostic, and Atheist backgrounds. Students are able to eat a meal that nourishes their physical bodies while holding conversations about life. During this time, showing the love of Christ is showing hospitality and providing a listening and empathetic ear. Jesus said feed the hungry and in recent years there has been a growing awareness of food insecurity on college campuses. Open Door strives to feed students at Drexel University physically and spiritually."
